###Project Description

Image recognization and object classification is a popular problem in research of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It's a complex process including Data preprocessing, applying decision algorithm and result evaluation.

The project will be divided into 2 main procedures:
> Butterfly detection 

In this procedure, we have to identify the butterfly from the whole picture, and try to do image segmentation and form a independent image showing butterfly more distinct. There are 3 main approaches differently based on threshold, margin and region.

The potential technics we may use in this procedure including wathershed, meanshift or CNNs and so on. We will make a comparison between the methods and try to get a best solution of the procedure. And then we will decide which method is best for the problem and show it in the presentation(probably may use CNNS).


    
>Butterfly Classification

After getting the real location of the butterfly in the picture, we will try to figure out some key parameters(eg. the size of the wings, the colors, the length of the tentacle) of the butterfly to build the classifier. 

We also have different methods for classification. Such as SVM(support vector machine), Naive Bayes , kNN or so on. The same as before, we will try to test the performance of the classifier and then dicide which method to presentation.


###Programming Language and Tools

python, tenorflow
